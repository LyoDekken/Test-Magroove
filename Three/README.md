============================ Magroove SQL Test ============================

This is a simple test to assess your knowledge of SQL queries and your hability to learn by yourself.

- Goal:

Learn to write SQL queries that extract, combine, and manipulate data.

- To start this test:

Make sure you have SQLite installed.

You also may want to work with the SQLite database using an intuitive GUI tool. There are many GUI tools you can use, here are some suggestions: DBeaver, SQLiteStudio, DB Browser, etc.

Open your favorite GUI tool, import the database file - that you can find in the test folder - and start querying the data.

The DB represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

- The actual test:

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Keep your successful queries in a .sql file.

1. Write a query that returns all playlist names;

2. Write a query that returns the 3 oldest employees who live in Calgary. The resultant table should include the Employee's full name and job position;

3. Write a query that returns the number of tracks with same genre;

4. Write a query that returns the top 10 longest albums. The resultant table should include the Album's ID and total milliseconds;

5. Write a query that returns date and total + basic Customer info for each Invoice. (HINT: Simple join);

6. Write a query that returns the name of all tracks in Playlist 1; (HINT: Use subquery, no need for join)

7. Write a query that returns all employees who are managers. The resultant table should include the Employee's full name and email;
